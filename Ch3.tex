\begin{itemize}
\item $L$ has $2$ poles, so $\rho$ is the sum of two unramified characters
\item $L$ has $1$ pole, so $\rho$ is the sum of an unramified character and a tamely ramified character
\item $L$ has no poles:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho$ is the sum of two tamely ramified characters
\item $\rho$ is a $2$ dimensional tamely ramified irreducible induced by a tamely ramified character of an unramified quadratic extension
\end{itemize}
