\item $\gamma$ has no poles; use stability and twist by highly ramified characters 
\end{itemize}
\item 2D Local Converse Theorem 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\gamma$ has $2$ poles, 
\begin{itemize} 
\item $\rho$ is the sum of two unramified characters
\end{itemize}
\item $\gamma$ has $1$ pole
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho$ is the sum of an unramified character and a tamely ramified character
\item $\rho$ is the sum of two unramified characters, one of which is $1/q$ times the other cancelling out a pole and a zero in $\gamma$
\end{itemize}
\item $\gamma$ has no poles:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho$ is the sum of two tamely ramified characters; then twisting by a level $1$ character gives $|\epsilon| \sim q^{1-2s}$. We have $\chi_1 \oplus \chi_2$ and $\chi_1' \oplus \chi_2'$. Twist both by $\chi_1^{-1}$ to force an unramified character, the poles of $\gamma$ must match, so either $\chi_1^{-1} \otimes \chi_1'$ or $\chi_1^{-1} \otimes \chi_2'$ must be unramified and infact equal to identity. Then we only have one character and can use stability. If we end up with $\chi_1 = \chi_2$ we get two poles after twisting and same on the other side.
\item $\rho$ is a $2$ dimensional tamely ramified irreducible induced by a tamely ramified character of an unramified quadratic extension; then twisting by a level $1$ character gives $|\epsilon| \sim q^{\frac{1}{2}-s}$. In this case, both characters must be induced by a tamely ramified character of the same unramified quadratic extension, so we can deal with the character instead of the dim $2$ irreducible. There we just use stability to prove the characters are the same. There will need to be a discussion of the Langlands constant and induction of $\epsilon$ here.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Do we ever actually need the finite field local converse theorem? 
\item Can we use finite field local converse theorem instead of stability?
\item Why does this proof technique break down eventually?
\item How far can it get? Can it prove $n = 3,4,5?$ Is $n=6$ when you start needing dim $2$ twists?
\item Can you get highly ramified $n=2$? Stability doesn't work as well here because of the level restrictions. What changes with non-semisimple $n=2$?
\end{itemize}

\section{Local Fields}
We are interested in a local converse theorem for smooth representations of the Weil group of a local field.We are interested in a local converse theorem for smooth representations of the Weil group of a local field.
Most of the material on local fields will echo that in Jean-Pierre Serre's \textit{Local Fields} \cite{Serre1979}, with the material on local class field theory coming from from Bushnell and Henniart's \textit{The Local Langlands Conjecture for $GL(2)$} \cite{Bushnell2006}.
Adopting the notation in the second of these references, we will have the following notation for local fields.\\
$F$ refers to a non-Archimedean local field.\\
$\fo$ is the discrete valuation ring in $F$.\\
$\fp$ is the unique maximal ideal of $\fo$.\\
$k = \fo/\fp$ is the residue field of $F$.\\
$q = p^n = |k|$ is the size of the residues field where $p$ is the characteristic.\\
$U_F$ is the group of units of $\fo$.\\
$U_F^n = 1 + \fp^n$ for $n \geq 1$ are subgroups of the unit group forming a filtration.\\
\begin{defn}
  A \textbf{discrete valuation ring} is a principal ideal domain $\fo$ with a unique non-zero prime ideal $\fp$.
\end{defn}
We also call such a ring $\fo$ a DVR.
An alternative characterization of a DVR is that it is a domain $\fo$ such that its field of fractions $K$ has a non-trivial valuation $v : K \to \bbZ \cup \{ \infty \}$; that is, a function $v$ such that $v(xy) = v(x) + v(y)$, $v(x+y) \geq \min \{v(x),v(y)\}$, $v(x) = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$, and $v$ takes more values than just $0$ and $\infty$.
\begin{defn}
  A \textbf{local field} is a field $F$ with a valuation $v$ that is locally compact with respect to the topology provided by the valuation and has finite residue field $k$ with $|k| = q = p^n$.
  The valuation defines a basis of open sets as the additive cosets of the $v^{-1}(\{x \in F \mid q^{-v(x)} \leq r\})$ for positive real numbers $r$.
\end{defn}
Given a local field $F$, it is not difficult to show that $\fo = \{x \in F \mid q^{-v(x)} \leq 1\}$ is the ring of integers of $F$ and is a DVR.
Further, $\fp = \{x \in F \mid q^{-v(x)} < 1\}$ is unique maximal (prime) ideal of the DVR $\fo$.
Finally, $\fo^\times = U_F = \{x \in F \mid q^{-v(x)} = 1\} = \{x \in F \mid v(x) = 0\}$ is the unit group of $\fo$.
A local field is isomorphic as a topological field to $\bbR$, $\bbC$, a finite extension of the $p$-adic numbers $\bbQ_p$, or the field of formal Laurent series $\bbF_q((T))$ over a finite field.
$\bbR$ and $\bbC$ are Archimedean local fields, so extensions of $\bbQ_p$ and $\bbF_q((T))$ will be the examples of the non-Archimdean local fields under consideration.

\section{$L$ Functions and $\epsilon$ Factors of Local Fields}
Though we are interested in the representation theory of the Weil group, and how we can tell apart the representations of the Weil group, in order to define the objects we will use to do so, we must first define them for local fields.
