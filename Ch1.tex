\chapter{Introduction}	%Chapter title
\begin{itemize}

\item What is the local converse theorem for representations of the Weil group?
\item How has the local converse theorem for representation of the Weil group been proven before? And what precisely has been proven? Mention Langlands briefly
\item What is the local converse theorem for gauss sums/characters of finite fields?
\item What precisely has been proven here? Has Nien's conjecture been proven?
\item Draw the analogs between the finite field and finite dimension cases?
\item What are future directions for the problem?
\item Entirely random question that doesn't actually need to be here, but can you define Gauss sums for any finite group and have some sort of converse theorem there when not all representations are characters?
\item What known counter examples are there for the Weil group or the finite field versions?
\item Does the general introductory material on Gauss sums, finite fields, and Weil groups go here, or in chapters 1 and 2?
