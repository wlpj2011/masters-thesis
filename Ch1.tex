\begin{itemize}

\item What is the local converse theorem for representations of the Weil group?
\item Conjugacy/equivalence of representations
\item How has the local converse theorem for representation of the Weil group been proven before? And what precisely has been proven? Mention Langlands briefly
\item $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ is sharp generally
\item What is the local converse theorem for gauss sums/characters of finite fields?
\item What precisely has been proven here? Has Nien's conjecture been proven?
\item Draw the analogs between the finite field and finite dimension cases?
\item What are future directions for the problem?
\item Does the general introductory material on Gauss sums, finite fields, and Weil groups go here, or in chapters 2 and 3?
\item Just state the definitions enough to fully define the theorem
